# Trees: Breadth-first search

To succeed at this challenge, you'll need to demonstrate that you can do the following:

- Implement breadth-first search traversal of a BST.

> *Note: If downloading the assessment files to your local machine, make sure you're running Node v18 before you run* `npm install`.
>
> 1.  *Check which version you are running:* `node -v`
> 2.  *If needed, change the version to v18:* `nvm use v18`
>
> _For additional help, review the "Learn your tools: Visual Studio Code" lesson in the "Welcome" module._

## Instructions

Your goal for this lesson is to get the tests to pass.

To do so, you will be modifying the existing `BinarySearchTree` class to add methods that traverse the BST using in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals.

### Existing files

| File path                 | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/BinarySearchTree.js` | Contains the definition of the `BinarySearchTree` class. The `constructor()` method and methods from the previous assessments have already been completed for you. |

### Tasks

Complete the following tasks to pass the tests and this assessment.

In the `src/BinarySeachTree.js` file, complete the `bfs()` method to visit the BST using a breadth-first search algorithm. You can use the provided `Queue` class in your implementation.

Once these tasks are complete, all tests should pass.
